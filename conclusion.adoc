So in conclusion!

* Future-proof code isn't disruptive
* Leaking complexity causes disruptive code
* To tame this complexity, you should:
** plan for your packages to expand without disruption
   using the previously discussed tools
** convert chaos to order as close to the entry point as you can
** find and build deep abstractions around your business logic
   instead of stitching together shallow functions,
** and ensure that information flows consistently in one direction
   without backtracking

Thank you!
