Finding and fixing problems.

Quick reminder:
I said earlier that packages cause disruptions
because of a design that leaks complexity.

In this section,
I'll talk about patterns that tend to cause leaks,
and how you could fix them.

Okay, let's get into it.

// TODO Maybe:
//
// * Unstoppable goroutines
// ** Add a means of stopping them -- context or otherwise
// ** Never spawn in `init()`
// * Errors: structured and sentinel
// * Bidirectional channels at boundaries / channels are rare

= Built-in obsession

:fix-string: String overuse
:fix-map: Map overuse
:fix-bool: Boolean overuse

[.column]
--
Reluctance to declare types,
instead preferring built-in types

[.medium, step=2]
* {fix-string}
* {fix-map}
* {fix-bool}
--

[.notes]

One way to leak complexity is an over-reliance on built-in types.
`string`, `bool`, `map`, etc. -- they're so easy to use.
So someone can end up in a mindset of using only them,
instead of declaring new types or domain objects,
because it might (*step*, *air-quotes*) "add complexity".

This results in leaking implementation details and complexity outside --
these would otherwise be hidden.

This practice can manifest in a few ways.
I'll talk about a couple of them:

* (*step*) String typing: Using strings everywhere.
* (*step*) Maps at boundaries: Using maps where a struct would be better
* (*step*) Boolean overuse: Using booleans where an enum would be better

= Zooming out

So I've been talking about very specific code samples.
As promised, I'm going to zoom out now.
Now I want to talk about an application holistically.

= Finding the abstraction

[.notes]
--
Okay, so I've mentioned this a couple times.
The idea of finding the right abstraction to hide complexity.

The concepts I just brought up:
flow of information, scope, surface area, and depth.
You can use those to help you find the abstraction.

= Writing the abstraction

[.notes]
--
Some tips for writing the abstraction once you've found it.
--

== Start on the outside

* Don't implement right away
* Decide the contract first

[.notes]
--
Start on the outside:

* Don't jump into the implementation right away.
* Figure out the purpose of the abstraction,
  and its contract before you start implementing it.
** By contract, I mean, what's the input, what's the output --
   where do the responsibilities of this object start versus end.
--

== Plan for expansion

include::expand-table.adoc[]

[.notes]
--
Use the tools we discussed earlier
to plan for expansion of the abstraction, its inputs, and outputs.
--

== Name things clearly

* Don't be redundant
* Don't build a kitchen sink
** No 'helper' or 'util'
* Consistency over all else

[.notes]
--
TODO

* Kitchen sink
** 'helper' is uninformative
** 'util' will always be wide and shallow
* Consistency
** New terms have to be incorporated by a reader
   into their mental model of an abstraction.
** Re-use similar names for similar concepts.
** If you have something called UserDetails already,
   don't introduce PostData. Call it PostDetails.
--

== Document it

* Write down the contract
* No self-documenting code
* Document all exported objects
+
[%step]
[source,yaml]
----
# .golangci.yml

issues:
  # Re-enable requiring all exported entities
  # to be documented.
  exclude-use-default: false
----

[.notes]
--
* Document it. Many people miss this part.
* There's no such thing as self-documenting code.
* I'm personally a big fan of the old golint rule
  that requires all exported things must be documented.
  I still enable it in my code.
** Revive has it enabled by default.
** golangci-lint disables that check by default,
   but you can enable it with this snippet (*step*),
   although it drops a few other default exclusions too.
   Personally, I haven't found that to be a problem.

[.columns]
== Make the implementation match the contract

[.column.is-one-third]
--
--

[.column.is-two-thirds.text-left]
--
üëé "This is what it does" +
üëç "This is what it's supposed to do"
--

[.notes]
--
I may be repeating myself here,
but it's important that the contract inform the implementation,
not the other way around.
--

== Don't leak the implementation

* Insulate internals from the outside world
* Avoid primitive obsession
* Define domain objects

// TODO: diagram

[.notes]

== Don't backtrack the flow of information

Information fed once should not be fed again

// TODO: diagram

== Don't add features, incorporate

* Features do not exist in isolation
* Adjust the mental model
+
[source,go]
----
type SiteGen struct{ AddSlash bool }
/* versus */
type SiteGen struct{ LinkStyle LinkStyle }
----
* It's okay to say No

[.notes]
--
Don't just 'add' a feature.
Features don't exist in isolation.
Consider how the feature interacts with other features.

See how it fits into your mental model of the abstraction.
Can you adjust the mental model to account for it?
Think back to the site generator example.
An "AddSlash" boolean does not fit there for me,
but an object responsible for styling links does.

If it breaks the model, if you can't incorporate it,
it's okay to say no.
