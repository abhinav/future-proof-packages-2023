When you're accepting an abstraction as input,
it should be an interface, not a concrete implementation.
Otherwise you're left with no room for expansion.

This is generally a good choice if two components
are very loosely coupled.
For example, my parser doesn't *have* to know that it's reading from a file.

This doesn't apply only to interfaces that already exist.

You can define and accept interfaces even for types you don't own
with only those methods that you need.

Doing this allows you to extend your input with upcasting.

For example, if my old Parse function
wanted to know the file name to use in error messages,
if I was using `*os.File`, I could just call `File.Name`.

But with the interface, I have to upcast it like so...

I define a new interface named `Source`.
Its `Name()` method matches `os.File.Name()`.

So if the `io.Reader` passed into `Parse` implements this method,
I'll use the file name.
Otherwise, I'll fall back to unknown.

This method is great;
it allows me to *optionally* upgrade an abstraction I'm consuming
and make it richer.

However, it's not magic. It's easily breakable. (*step*)
If a user wraps the interface in an object
that doesn't know to implement the optional functionality,
that upgrade path is lost.

To help mitigate that:

* (*step*)
  Make the upgrade path obvious with documentation and convention.
  Make it so that a caller loses the upgrade path only if they intended to.
*  (*step*) And prefer to use smaller interfaces.
  It's easier to talk about the upgrade path
  when there's only one method to talk about.

// This is a pretty powerful tool;
