= Big interfaces

[.notes]
--
Big interfaces for something you define and return
can be indicative of tight coupling between components.

There are some ways you can make these smaller.

TODO

== Focus on the request path

[.notes]
--
When deciding what goes on the interface,
don't just list all the methods of the object on the interface.
Think about the request path --
methods that will be called many times per object.

For example, don't add the Close method on the interface for TODO.
Leave that exposed on the struct.

== Build a powerful core

[.notes]
--
For some objects where all methods have the same backend,
one cool thing you can do is define the powerful base method:
I call it the engine here.

It's the thing that everything else relies on.

Take that engine, put a struct around it, implement methods on it.
