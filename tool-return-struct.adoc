= Return ``struct``s

This may seem odd, but how interface upcasting
allows us to increase what an input can do,
returning a stuct allows you to increase what an output can do.

Just by returning a struct instead of an interface value,
you're left free to add new methods to the struct.

Again, as with interface upcasting, this is a bit specific in its usage.
I'm intentionally referring to this as a tool rather than a solution.
It doesn't fit everywhere.
