Finding and fixing problems.

Quick reminder:
I said earlier that packages cause disruptions
because of a design that leaks complexity.

In this section,
I'll talk about patterns that tend to cause leaks,
and how you could fix them.

Okay, let's get into it.

// TODO Maybe:
//
// * Unstoppable goroutines
// ** Add a means of stopping them -- context or otherwise
// ** Never spawn in `init()`
// * Errors: structured and sentinel
// * Bidirectional channels at boundaries / channels are rare

= Built-in obsession

:fix-string: üßµ String overuse
:fix-map: üó∫Ô∏è Map overuse
:fix-bool: üéÇ Boolean overuse

Reluctance to declare types,
instead preferring built-in types

[none, step=2]
* {fix-string}
* {fix-map}
* {fix-bool}

One way to leak complexity is an over-reliance on built-in types.
`string`, `bool`, `map`, etc. -- they're so easy to use.
So someone can end up in a mindset of using only them,
instead of declaring new types or domain objects,
because it might (*step*, *air-quotes*) "add complexity".

This results in leaking implementation details and complexity outside --
these would otherwise be hidden.

This practice can manifest in a few ways.
I'll talk about a couple of them:

* (*step*) {fix-string}
* (*step*) {fix-map}
* (*step*) {fix-bool}

// ** You can implement a class a closure doesn't mean you should.
// ** Isolate concepts, give them names, add interfaces (middleware example)
// *** Closure want to be objects when they grow up

= Interface misuse

:fix-premature-iface: ü•ö Premature interfaces
:fix-big-iface: ü¶ñ Big interfaces

[none%step]
* {fix-premature-iface}
* {fix-big-iface}

I just spent some time selling interfaces.
Now let's talk about misusing them.

I'm going to cover two topics:

* (*step*) Premature interfaces:
  When packages define interfaces before they need to
* (*step*) and big interfaces:
  when packages define interfaces that are larger
  than they need to be
