Finding and fixing problems.

First, just to recap,
I said earlier that packages aren't future-proof
if changing them causes disruptions,
and I claimed that that's a symptom of a design that leaks complexity.

So how do we go about fixing these leaks?
I will talk about this at two levels:

* First, low-level closer to the code.
  Patterns you should keep an eye out for
  that *probably* leak complexity.
* After that, I'll zoom out and talk about design at a higher level.

As I get into the first section,
please be aware that I'll be making generalizations.
The way to interpret this is
"code that looks like this tends to leak complexity".

// TODO: probably don't need to hedge here.

Okay, let's get into it.

// TODO:
//
// Maybe:
//
// * Unstoppable goroutines
// ** Add a means of stopping them -- context or otherwise
// ** Never spawn in `init()`
// * Naming: names and scopes
// ** Inconsistency in naming
// ** Stuttering
// ** Document public API of internal types with exported names
// ** Consistency above all else
// * Errors: structured and sentinel
// * Bidirectional channels at boundaries / channels are rare

= Over-reliance on primitives

[.notes]
--
Something that makes it easy to leak complexity is
an over-reliance on primitive types in your core logic.

strings, bools, and ints are available everywhere -- they're so easy to use --
so I use them everywhere because defining a type "adds complexity" to my code.
As a result of that, I end up leaking that complexity outside.

I think this is better demonstrated with an example.

= Zooming out

So I've been talking about very specific code samples.
As promised, I'm going to zoom out now.
Now I want to talk about an application holistically.

= Finding the abstraction

[.notes]
--
Okay, so I've mentioned this a couple times.
The idea of finding the right abstraction to hide complexity.

The concepts I just brought up:
flow of information, scope, surface area, and depth.
You can use those to help you find the abstraction.

// Finding the abstraction
// * currying as a tool for building abstractions
// ** shared arguments => object
// * start by documenting the contract when adding a new type/function
// ** make the contract inform the implementation, not the other way around
// ** there's no such thing as self-documenting code
// ** I'm a big fan of the old golint rule:
//    every exported entity must be documented.
// * define a domain language
// * Use tests to help inform abstractions
// * Application-scoped vs request-scoped information
// ** Use scope of information to inform abstraction design.
//    Things that change rarely, vs things that change often.
// ** Accepted interfaces should be request scoped
