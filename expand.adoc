= Planning for expansion

* 🧮 Functions
* 💡 Abstractions

The first step towards future-proofing is planning for expansion.
Designing functions and abstractions in a way
so that they can do more in the future.

I'll talk about expansion on two levels:
expanding functions, and expanding abstractions.

= 🧮 Expanding functions

* Parameter objects
* Result objects
* Functional options

[.notes]
--
Let's talk about functions first.
I'll cover three ideas here:
Parameter objects,
Result objects,
and Functional options.

include::expand-params.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::expand-results.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::expand-func-opts.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

= 💡 Expanding abstractions

* Accept interfaces
* Return structs

[.notes]
--
Okay, that covers functions. Let's talk about abstractions.

There are two standard practices you can follow here
to plan for expansion of abstractions.

include::expand-accept-iface.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::expand-return-struct.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

= Planning for expansion

include::expand-table.adoc[]

[.notes]
--
So to summarize, to plan for expansion:

* For function inputs and outputs, we have:
** Parameter objects, result objects, and functional options
* For received and produced abstractions, we have:
** accepting interfaces and upcasting them
** returning structs and adding methods to them
