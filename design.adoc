= Zooming out

[.notes]
--
So I've been talking about very specific code samples.
As promised, I'm going to zoom out now.
Now I want to talk about an application holistically.

= Finding the abstraction

[.notes]

Okay, so I've mentioned this a couple times.
The idea of finding the right abstraction to hide complexity.

The concepts I just brought up:
flow of information, scope, surface area, and depth.
You can use those to help you find the abstraction.

Some tips for writing the abstraction once you've found it

* (*step*) Start on the outside:
  Decide the contract first, document it, and *then* implement it.
* (*step*) Name things clearly:
** Pick a consistent naming scheme,
   and re-use terms for similar concepts of introducing new ones.
** For example, if you have UserDetails already,
   don't introduce PostData -- call it PostDetails.
   Each new term is a new thing a user has to incorporate
   into their mental model of the package.
** Oh and don't create kitchen sink packages like 'util'.
   That's what causes shallow and wide business code.
// * (*step*) Use the tools discussed previously --
//   parameter and result objects, functional options,
//   accept interfaces, return structs --
//   to plan for expansion of the abstractoin.
* (*step*) Don't leak the implementation.
  Define domain-specific data types,
  and expose those from your abstraction.
* (*step*) Lastly, don't just add a new feature.
  Features don't exist in isolation.
  Consider how the new feature interacts with other features,
  and integrate it.
  Don't just add an `OmitSlash` boolean, add a `LinkStyle` property.
