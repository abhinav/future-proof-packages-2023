First, about me.

Hi, I'm Abhinav. I work at Rippling.

Before that,
I worked at Pulumi, helping with their Go SDK,
and at Uber, leading the Go Frameworks team.

You can find me on my blog, GitHub, and Mastodon.

I've been working on libraries and frameworks,
primarily in Go, for several years now,
and in that period I've developed opinions
on maintainability and future-proofing.

I'm going to share some of those opinions with you today.
