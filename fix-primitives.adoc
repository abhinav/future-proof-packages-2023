= Over-reliance on primitives

== Repeated primitives

[.notes]
--
If you find yourself repeating the same group of primitives
over and over again as arguments, fields, etc. use a struct.
--

== Overly specific booleans

[.notes]
--
This is a common mistake.

You have functionality, it works fine.
Someone wants to customize a specific behavior for their specific need,
and so you add an overly specific boolean flag.

// TODO: example

Avoid this.
Find the behavior being replaced, extract it,
and then make it an interface or an enum.
--

== String matching

[.notes]
--
TODO: strings everywhere.
String matching instead of parsing.

Bad: Extracting scheme with "search for first `:`".

Parsing is how we interface with the untyped world.

In short...

== Use types effectively
