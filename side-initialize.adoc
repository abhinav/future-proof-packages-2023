= Initializing objects

[.notes]
--
As a tangent, I want to quickly talk about object initialization.

I just mentioned parameter objects and functional options.
These allow for two different ways to initialize complex objects.
But they're not the only ways.
--

[.columns]
== Usable zero value

[.column.is-one-third]
--
[source, go]
----
var (
  buff bytes.Buffer
  lock sync.Mutex
  tree MyTree[int]
)
----
--

[.column.text-left]
--
[%hardbreaks]
üëç Easy
üëç Extend with exported fields

[.medium]
Prefer when possible
--

[.notes]
--
For simple-enough objects, make is so that their zero value is usable --
so that it's possible to declare it with just a `var`.
These objects can still export fields to customize the default behaviors,
but should be usable without doing so.

Of course, objects that meet this criteria are not super common.
There are usually at least one or two required dependencies.
--

[.columns]
== Exported required fields

[.column]
--
[source,go]
----
type PrefixWriter struct {
  Writer io.Writer /* required */
  Prefix string
}
----
--

[.column.text-left]
--
[%hardbreaks]
üëç Easy
üëé Validate repeatedly

[.medium]
Prefer for objects with 1-2 methods
--

[.notes]
--
In that case, we can still get away with vanilla structs;
we just have to say which fields are required.

This is easy to use,
but it's a bit annoying if you have too many methods.
Because there's no enforcement that the required fields are set,
they have to be checked at every entry point -- every method.
Someone will forget a method somewhere and then it'll explode at runtime.

But I think this is worth it if you have only one or two methods.
It's hard to miss validation there, and you get something super easy to use.

When you can't do this, it's time to write constructors.

== Constructors

[cols="1,1a,1", frame=none]
|====

| Positional arguments
| [source,go]
----
func NewCore(
  enc Encoder,
  ws  WriteSyncer,
  lvl LevelEnabler,
) Core
----
| 3 or fewer inputs

| Parameter objects
| [source,go]
----
func NewJSONEncoder(
  cfg EncoderConfig,
) Encoder
----
| 4 or more inputs

| Functional options
| [source,go]
----
func New(
  core zapcore.Core,
  opts ...Option,
) *Logger
----
| Only if worth it

|====

For constructors, prefer them in this order:

* Use positional arguments for 3 or fewer inputs --
  assuming that's all you'll ever need.
* Use a parameter object if you have more inputs than that.
* Use functional options if the boilerplate and complexity is worth it.

[.columns.wrap]
== Initializing objects

[.column.is-full.medium]
In-order, prefer...

[.column.is-half]
--
Plain objects

. Usable zero value
. Exported required fields
--

[.column.is-half]
--
Constructor

[start=3]
. Positional arguments
. Parameter object
. Functional options
--

[.notes]
--
So in summary, to initialize objects:

* Prefer plain objects with a usable zero value
  or with required fields if the number of methods is small.
* Or if you need a constructor,
  prefer positional arguments, parameter object, or functional options,
  in that order depending on the number of arguments
  and your appetite for complexity.
