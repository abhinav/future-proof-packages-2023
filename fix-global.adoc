Let's talk about global state.

Okay, yeah, you all probably already know global variables should be avoided.
That's not what I want to talk about.

Implicit process globals.

I'm referring to (*step*) standard out, standard in,
environment variables, etc.
These are all a form of global state for your program.

It's easy to use these anywhere in your program.
(*step*)
If environment variable is set, use cool new feature.
Log a message to standard out.

There's nothing wrong about this in particular.
However, I'd like to make the claim that (*step*)
you should not read or write process globals
outside the `main` package.

(*step*) Instead, isolate your business logic
from knowledge of the process state.
No package besides `main` should know about the process state.

A good way to do this is to extract information from your process globals
as early as possible,
and then inject it down where it's needed.

* Need to check for a feature flag? (*step*)
  Extract all feature flags into a struct and pass that down.
* Need to write messages to the user? (*step*)
  Grab a reference to `os.Stdout`, and pass that down as an io.Writer.
* Need to look up arbitrary environment variables?
  That's okay; Go has function references.
  (*step*) Inject a reference to `os.Getenv` down where it's needed.

You're probably thinking that that `run` function
will get pretty ungainly if we do this for everything.

I agree. We can fix that.

We talked about parameter objects before.
That fits right in.

Or equivalently, (*step*) an object with a Run method.

Regardless, if you isolate your business logic from process globals,
you'll find that it makes your application logic much easier to test.
