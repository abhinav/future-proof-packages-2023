First, I want to introduce this concept.
I don't know if there's a formal name for this, but I've been calling it
flow of information --
the path that information takes to go through your application.

Its shape may change as it passes through,
but the information represented is similar if not the same.

Flow in one direction [.step]#without backtracking#

[.notes]

For example, when you parse command line arguments,
the slice of strings gets transformed to, say, an `Options` struct.
It's roughly the same information,
but with unimportant bits chipped away.

Similarly, (*step*)
when you parse an HTTP request --
maybe JSON decoding the body,
and extracting some information from headers --
it's again roughly the same information minus the unimportant bits.

In both cases, (*step*) information flows in one direction.
We don't touch the original list of command line arguments,
or the original request body again.
That is, (*step*) there's no backtracking.

Apply the same principle to chaotic data --
strings and other primitives that hold structure.
Interpret their structure once, and never go back to it.

Think back to the section about parsing.
We had a function that matched the scheme -- HTTP or SSH --
and downloaded a file.

(*step*) Even narrowing to just the SSH flow,
we backtrack to the string and re-interpret its meaning.
Every function that touches the chaotic string
has to interpret the structure of the string.
It cannot *assume* that the string is a URL, it has to check.

(*step*) Compare that with parsing the string early.
Information flows forward and nobody touches the chaotic form again.

Zigzagging flow indicates a leak
--

[.notes]
--
The consistent flow of information is important at the micro level
as well as the macro level.
Consider how information flows between functions or packages?
Is it flowing in one direction consistently or zigzagging (*step*)?

If it's zigzagging,
there's either a leak of complexity,
or a very tight coupling between these objects.
