Rough agenda for the next 40 or so minutes:

* I'll talk about the concept of future-proof packages
* what prevents packages from being future-proof
* and lastly how to future-proof packages:
** In this last section,
   I'll talk about finding and fixing issues
   that prevent future-proof packages,
   as well as preventing issues entirely.

Okay, let's get into it.
