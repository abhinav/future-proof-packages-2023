Changes for each request

I want to talk about the concept of scope.
I don't mean this in terms of lexical scope,
but more in terms of lifetime.

Consider two kinds of scope:

* (*step*) Application scope is for values that don't really change
  while your application is running.
  Your `os.Args`, the process' environment variables, etc.
  Yes, we can mutate them, but practically,
  they're constant as far as any business logic in concerned.
* (*step*) And request scope. Things that change per request.
  Obviously, this includes your HTTP request.
  But what else?
  Well, everything, really. Depends on how you look at it.

Whether something is request scope or not depends
on which function you're looking at.

I said your command line arguments were application scope.
But to the command line parser, that's request scope.

So instead of a binary definition
it might be useful to think of scope as a gradient.

(*step*)
Things on the left change less often than things on the right.
Things on the left have a larger scope than things on the right.

`flag.Parse` views this gradient from further left of `os.Args`,
so from its point of view, `os.Args` is variable,
while from the point of view of `http.Handler`, it's constant.

This is something that's useful to think about
as you're designing abstractions.

Things with bigger scope, that is, things that change less often,
can be fields on an object instead of parameters of a function.

It's valuable to think about the scope of values as you're writing code.

As an example, (*step*) you can use it to help you design structs,
things with a scope larger than the object
can become fields of the struct instead of parameters.

Similarly, you can use it to design interfaces. (*step*)
If you're defining a new interface for your input,
only put request-scoped methods on it.
Think back to the RedisStore example, and how the Store interface
didn't have a Close method.

Finally, you can even use it to
help you decide on parameter ordering.
(*step*) Just sort parameters by scope: larger to smaller.
Things that change less often, go on the left,
things that change more often, on the right.
