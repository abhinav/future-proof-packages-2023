Next, I want to talk about the concept of scope.

Again, I'm just making up this term --
if you know a more formal name for it, please come find me afterwards.

By scope, I'm thinking not of lexical scope,
but what lifetime a value is bound to.

Consider two kinds of scope:

* (*step*) Application scope is for values that don't change between calls.
  Your `os.Args`, the process' environment variables, etc.
  Yes, we can mutate them, but practically,
  they're constant as far as any business logic in concerned.
* (*step*) And request scope. Things that change per call.
  Obviously, this includes your HTTP request.
  But what else? Well, everything, really. Depends on how you look at it.

Whether something is request scope or application scope depends
on your point of view.

Command line arguments are application scope, yes.
But from the point of view of a command line argument parser,
they're request scope.

So instead of a binary definition, think of scope as a gradient.
(*step*)

* As we go from left to right, the scope of each value gets smaller
  because it changes more often.
* So things on the left are application scoped to those on the right,
  and things on the right are request scoped to those on the left.

For example, `flag.Parse` views this from further left of `os.Args`,
so from its point of view, `os.Args` is request scope.
On the other hand, `http.Handler` views it from further right,
so from its point of view, `os.Args` is application scope.

Thinking about the relative scope of different values
can be really helpful in writing code.

For example,

* Use it to help you decide which inputs become struct fields,
  and which become method parameters.
  Things with a scope larger than a single struct value
  can become fields of the struct.
  Others can become parameters of methods on the struct.
* Similarly, use it to design interfaces.
  Only request-scoped methods go on the interface.
  Think back to the `RedisStore` example --
  Get and Set are request scoped, Close is not.
* Finally, you can even use the concept of scope
  to help you decide on parameter ordering if you're unsure.
  Just sort parameters by scope: larger to smaller.
  Things that change less often, go on the left,
  things that change more often, on the right.
