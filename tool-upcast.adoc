= Interface upcasts

TODO

[.notes]
--
Interface upcasting allows you to take a value that satisfies an interface
and cast it to a more specific interface.

Maybe:
This happens at runtime --
the value doesn't even have to know that the interface exists.

This is a useful tool, but it's limited.
If the value is wrapped in the middle, it cannot fit anymore.
