Quick intro.
I'm Abhinav. I work at Rippling.
Before that,
I worked at Pulumi, helping with their Go SDK,
and at Uber, leading the Go Frameworks team.

You can find me on my website, GitHub, and Mastodon.

I've been working on Go libraries and frameworks
in one form or another for the past 8 years of my career,
and in that period I've developed some opinions
on how packages can be made future-proof.
